Note that in Catalina Apple stores it's trash apps in the folder /System/Applications/ 
You can't remove it from your regular startup boot, even with csrutil disabled and using a sudo rm. It says they are readonly files, so issuing some chmod command would probably solve the issue,
but it works just fine if you do it from the recovery drive, you just need to cd in the /System/Applications folder insted of /Applications/
